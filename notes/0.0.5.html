        <h1>Fluency 0.0.5</h1>
        <p>Thank you for beta testing Fluency!</p>
        <h2>Improvements and Fixes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The menu bar item and "Jump To Page" now support searching all of Confluence as well as your local spaces. Non-local results show below local results, in a different section.</li>
            <li>Pages you visit will be cached so you can see their content without having to re-login. Stale page data is denoted with a banner.</li>
            <li>The Add Space window has been refactored for a more intuitive user experience</li>
            <li>The Add Space window automatically selects the search bar after being opened</li>
            <li>The Add Space window queries personal spaces in addition to global spaces</li>
            <li>Fix for an issue which caused icons to display incorrectly</li>
            <li>Fix for an issue where the Add Space window would sometimes not show a loading spinner</li>
            <li>Fix for an issue where the app would stall if you provided an invalid url when logging in</li>
            <li>Fix for an issue where table of contents rows would display indirectly if their headings included comments</li>
        </ul>
