        <h1>Fluency 0.0.2</h1>
        <p>Thank you for beta testing Fluency! This version is the first to use automatic updates and release notes.</p>
        <h2>Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fluency now supports images which are linked by url</li>
            <li>List items are now shown closer together, which I think is easier to read</li>
            <li>Click on a heading in any table of contents to jump to that heading</li>
            <li>Unsupported tags and macros have a new look which makes them easier to read</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed serveral colors which didn't display well in non-dark themes</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where while typing in the page tree search field, it would lose focus</li>
            <li>Fixed a crash when you enter the jump to page window but there are no results</li>
