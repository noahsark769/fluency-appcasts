        <h1>Fluency 0.0.3</h1>
        <p>Thank you for beta testing Fluency!</p>
        <h2>Improvements and Fixes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for images with outside URL sources. Images which are page attachments coming soon!</li>
            <li>Fluency's auth system is now more robust, which means your Confluence session should last longer without having to re-login.</li>
            <li>Tweak styles for monospaced text: it's now easier to see and outlined in gray</li>
            <li>Fixed: Issue where when filtering the page tree, the search field would lose focus</li>
